Problem is too large for student version of KNITRO
==================================================

Using the student version:
::

  Knitro 10.1.2 STUDENT LICENSE (problem size limit = 300)

  This edition is limited to 300 variables and 300 constraints,
  but you are requesting 551 variables and 732 constraints.
  To solve problems this large, you need to buy a license.
  Academic pricing is available.  See http://www.artelys.com/


Was able to download a 1 month trial of the full version of KNITRO!
