Modifications that Did not Work
================================

* The following investigation systematically  played with many different aspects of the formulation

  * A major modification was trying to more closely represent Euler's Backward Difference withing the Optimization

    * Previously the last two equations were:
      ::

        @NLconstraint(mdl, 0 == sa[i+1]  - sa[i]     - sr[i]*dt[i] )
        @NLconstraint(mdl, 0 == ax[i+1]  - ax[i]     - jx[i]*dt[i] )


    * I modified them to:
      ::
      
        @NLconstraint(mdl, 0 == sa[i+1]  - sa[i]     - sr[i+1]*dt[i] )
        @NLconstraint(mdl, 0 == ax[i+1]  - ax[i]     - jx[i+1]*dt[i] )

    * To do this I had to add a new DV for both JX and SR as the ``N+1`` step
    * It turned out this did not fix the issue

* Form all of these tests and investigations we learn:

  * It is better to leave the SR and JX DVs one step smaller than the rest of the DVs

    * At least for the current formulation

  * That differences between the VehicleModels.jl model and the optimization model may be leading into the infeasibility issues that we are steering

    * The current hypothesis is that there is a bug
