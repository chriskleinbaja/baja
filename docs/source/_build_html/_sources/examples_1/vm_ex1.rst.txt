Three Degree of Freedom Model
==============================

In this example only the control signals (SR and Jx) are used to solve the differential equations using Euler and RK4 techniques and the results are compared to the optimized signals.


**Notes & Conclusions:**

  * The differences between the optimized and the actual (using the differential equation solvers) are acceptable.
  * The animation simply demonstrates that the vehicles are avoiding obstacles:

      * The time scale is not correct, because there are different numbers of frames
      * It does not show the RK4 solution:

          * It is almost exactly the same as the Euler solution
