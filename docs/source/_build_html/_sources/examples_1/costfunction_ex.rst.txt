Cost Function
=============
For all of these test case, the following is used:

* the vehicle is being controlled with:

  * steering rate
  * longitudinal jerk
* the nonlinear pacejka tire model
* nonlinear acceleration constraints
* vertical tire load constraints
* the 3DoF vehicle model
* the vehicle is constrained to:

  * get to the goal
  * avoid obstacles
  
For all of these test case, the assumptions are made:

* the obstacle field is known

Nothing in the Cost Function
----------------------------
Here is an a test case with moving obstacles where there is nothing in the cost function.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   nothing_in_cost_function_1
   nothing_in_cost_function_2

Time in the Cost Function
-------------------------
Here is an a test case with moving obstacles where there is time in the cost function.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  time_in_cost_function_1
  time_in_cost_function_2

Nothing vs. Time
----------------
Now we will compare the results where there is noting in the cost function and where there is time in the cost function.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

.. _line_2_goal_ex_1:

Line to Goal
------------
Here is an a test case were the :ref:`line2goal` term is added.

Where the weight is:

* w_haf = 1.0e-5


.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  line_2_goal_1
  line_2_goal_2

Control Effort in Cost Function
-------------------------------
Here is an a test case were the :ref:`control_effort` term is added.

Where the weights are:

* w_ce = 1
* w_sa = 0.1
* w_sr = 1
* w_jx = 0.01

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  ce_obj_1
  ce_obj_2

Nothing vs. Control Effort
---------------------------

Now we will compare the results where there is nothing in the cost function and where there is a penalty on the control effort.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  nothing_vs_ce


Time vs. Control Effort
------------------------

Now we will compare the results where there is time in the cost function and where there is a penalty on the control effort.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  time_vs_ce

Soft Constraints on Vertical Tire Load in Cost Function
-------------------------------------------------------
Here is an a test case where the soft constraints on the tire forces are included in the objective function.

Where the weights are:

* Fz_min = 1000
* Fz_off = 100
* a_t = Fz_min + 3*Fz_off
* b_t = Fz_off

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  tf_obj_1
  tf_obj_2

Time vs. Soft Constraints on Vertical Tire Load
-----------------------------------------------
Now we will compare the results where there is time in the cost function and where there is a penalty on the vertical tire forces operating near their minimum.

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2

  time_vs_tire


All Terms For Getting to the Goal
---------------------------------
Where the terms are:

* Time
* Line to Goal
* Control Effort
* Soft Constraints on Vertical Tire Load

  :maxdepth: 2
