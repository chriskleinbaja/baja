First Optimization
==================

In this example only the first optimization is shown, that is, the loop is **not** being closed.

It can be seen that when the soft constraints on the tire forces are included in the objective function the vehicle reduces operates away from the minimum vertical tire load and when compared to time, and when time is the only thing in the objective function, we are able to arrive at the goal sooner.
