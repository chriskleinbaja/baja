VehicleModels.jl
================

This is a package that I created and it can be downloaded `from here <https://github.com/huckl3b3rry87/VehicleModels>`_.

 * The purpose of this package is to allow the easy collaboration and development of vehicle models.


The examples for this package are available by typing:
::

  using IJulia
  notebook(dir = Pkg.dir("VehicleModels")*"/examples")

.. toctree::
