NLOptControl.jl
================

This is a package that I am developing that allows for the easy inclusion of ordinary differential equation (ODE) constraints into the optimal control problem. Initially, I will focus on developing functionality to use a psuedospectral method to solve the optimal control problem.

  * The package is `aqui <https://github.com/huckl3b3rry87/NLOptControl.jl>`_.

  * The documentation for this package is `here <http://nloptcontroljl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
